/**
 * The GitHub and LinkedIn glyphs lucide-react removed in 1.0, which dropped
 * every brand icon. The icon nodes below are copied unchanged from
 * lucide-react 0.564.0 (dist/esm/icons/github.js and linkedin.js), the last
 * version this site used with them, so the links look as they did.
 *
 * They are built with lucide-react's own createLucideIcon, so they take the
 * same props, default size and stroke, `lucide lucide-<name>` classes and
 * aria handling (aria-hidden unless an aria-* prop, role or title is passed)
 * as every other icon on the site.
 *
 * Lucide's license (lucide-react 0.564.0's LICENSE file, verbatim) covers
 * these nodes:
